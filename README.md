After downloading, copy the datapack into your world's `datapacks` folder and the resource pack into Minecraft's `resourcepacks` folder.

## Build
If you want to build the resource pack and datapack yourself, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed.

Then, run the following commands in the project root:
```bash
yarn install
yarn build
```
the resource pack and datapack will be generated in the `out` folder. You can copy them to your Minecraft `resourcepack` and `datapack` folder respectively.
